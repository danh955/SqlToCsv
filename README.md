# SqlToCsv

I wrote this little program maybe 2005 or so.  It was used to export data from SQL queries to a CSV file.    A SQL Server Agent ran on a schedule to get the CSV file and emailed to the user for reporting purposes.  Then the user was able to open the CSV file into Excel.

The program was also used to import CSV file into SQL server.

[Here is the help file](https://github.com/danh955/SqlToCsv/tree/master/Resources/Help.txt).
